## **Spam Classifier using Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF in NLP**

#### This repository contains code for a spam classifier using Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The classifier is designed to identify whether an input text message is spam or not.

### **Introduction**


##### Spam detection is a common task in NLP aimed at identifying unsolicited or unwanted messages, typically sent in bulk, such as email spam or SMS spam. This classifier utilizes two popular techniques in text processing:

### **Bag-of-Words (BoW):**
##### This method represents text data as a collection of words, ignoring grammar and word order. Each document is represented as a vector where each feature corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary, and the value represents the frequency of that word in the document.

### **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**
#### TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It takes into account not only the frequency of a word in a document (term frequency) but also the rarity of the word in the entire corpus (inverse document frequency).

### **Dataset**
#### UCI Machine Learning Repo
#### dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection 
### The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset consisting of text messages labeled as spam or non-spam (ham). The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
